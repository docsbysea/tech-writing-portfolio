## Script

### Title Slide  
Hello, everybody! This is the first part of a three-part video series explaining the workflow of the DC project. I’m Seethalaxmi Palkumar, and in this video, I will walk you through the tool we will be working with. It’s called Superannotate.  

### Tool Introduction  
When opening the tool for the first time, you will need to create an account to get started. Once that’s done, this is the interface you’ll see.  

Here, under the **Sign in to Your Account** option, click on **SSO**. We all use a common denomination, which is the name of the company. Type **nvidia** in lowercase to gain access.  

### Project Allotment  
Once you enter, you will see all the projects assigned to you. From this list, click on the one you’re working on—**VDC in LLM**.  

Once the project is open, all the videos assigned to you will be listed. If none are available, click on **Request Tasks** at the top left to get tasks assigned.  

### Opening a Task  
Clicking on a video will bring you to this interface. Here, it is important to note the video's unique **ID**, which is used for tracking and documentation.  

To find the **ID**, click on the downward arrow next to the task name, then select the **info icon (ⓘ)** from the dropdown menu. This will display the task details, including the **ID**. Copy this **ID** and paste it into the assigned document for reference.  

### Task Set-Up  
The bar at the top displays two options: **Global** and **Event Captions**. Use the **Global Caption** section to write your global caption. Here, you will also mark **Yes** or **No** to indicate whether the video is of poor quality.  

Under **Events,** to create an event, click on **Add Event.** These fields are for entering your **start and end times**, and the caption goes in the designated field. You can add any number of events and delete them as needed.  

### Instructions  
- To **play** a video, click on **Play** or simply click anywhere on the video.  
- To **pause**, follow the same procedure.  
- To **zoom in**, place the cursor at the section you want to enlarge and use your **mouse or touchpad** to zoom in.  

### Quick Tip  
Sometimes, the video may go blank. When this happens:  
- Use the **refresh icon** to reload the page.  
- If that doesn’t work, use the **Reload this Page** option on your browser.  
- If you’ve already entered data, press **Ctrl + S** to save your work before refreshing to avoid data loss.  

### Additional Instructions  
- Clicking on the **Home** icon will take you back to the list of **IDs**.  
- The **Revert Task** icon clears everything that has been saved. A warning pop-up will appear, so if you click it by accident, you can **cancel before losing your work**.  
- Click **Skip Item** to skip a task. The reasons for skipping a task will be discussed in the next video.  
- When you’re done with a task, click **Quality Check** to submit it.  

### Closing Note  
And that’s all you need to get started with using Superannotate for this project. I’ll see you in the next part of this video series, where I’ll explain the project guidelines. Thank you for watching!
