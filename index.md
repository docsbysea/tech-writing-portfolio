My experience as a Prompt Engineer Associate, creating content for training AI models, has given me a strong foundation in structured writing. I am also familiar with GitHub and version control. With solid research and writing skills, I ensure that my documents serve their intended purpose effectively. I am proficient in DITA and tools like Oxygen XML Editor and FrameMaker. To demonstrate my understanding of tech writing, I have put together a few sample pieces on fundamental topics.
